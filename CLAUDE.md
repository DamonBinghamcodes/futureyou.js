This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

FutureYou.js is a minimal, aesthetic-first landing page for a brand that blends fitness, mindset, technology, streetwear culture, and high-performance lifestyle. The design inspiration comes from brands like Hidden.NY, Run Attire, and Apple's web design.

This is a "Coming Soon" landing page designed to build brand anticipation and gather emails for a waitlist, emphasizing mystery, high-performance culture, and aesthetic ambition.

## Brand Identity & Design Direction

- **Visual Theme**: Neon green on black, desaturated imagery
- **Aesthetic**: Minimal, high-performance, streetwear-influenced
