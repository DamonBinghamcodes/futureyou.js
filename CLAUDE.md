## Notes for Developers

### Working with the Newsline Banner
- Banner positioned at top of main-container, before hero section
- 4 identical text copies required for seamless 360-degree loop
- Animation translateX(-50%) moves exactly 2 copies (half the track)
- When animation resets, copies 3-4 appear where 1-2 started
- Glitch effects use pseudo-elements (::before, ::after) for layered RGB split
- Reduced-motion users get slower scroll (60s) with no glitch effects

### Working with Instagram Browser
- Always test Instagram link functionality in actual Instagram app
- Use the `isInstagramBrowser()` detection function for conditional logic
- Implement multiple fallback methods for external link navigation
- Apply Instagram-specific CSS classes for layout fixes

### Email Form Customization
- Mailchimp form ID and action URL are configured in index.html
- Apple-style animations defined in styles.css
- Input state management handled in script.js
- Responsive breakpoints ensure proper display on all devices

### Responsive Design Maintenance
- Mobile-first approach: start with 320px base styles
- Use progressive enhancement for larger screens
- Test all breakpoints, especially 375px, 390px, and 430px for mobile
- Instagram browser requires additional CSS overrides
- Footer uses flexbox, not absolute positioning

### Layout Architecture
- main-container: display: flex, flex-direction: column, justify-content: space-between
- hero-section: flex: 1, centers content vertically
- footer: position: relative, margin-top: auto, anchors to bottom
- This ensures content never overlaps and footer always stays at bottom

This project represents a production-ready landing page with advanced responsive design, tech-glitch aesthetics, infinite scrolling banner, Instagram browser compatibility, and professional email collection system integrated with Mailchimp.
