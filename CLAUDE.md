## Notes for Developers

### Working with Instagram Browser
- Always test Instagram link functionality in actual Instagram app
- Use the `isInstagramBrowser()` detection function for conditional logic
- Implement multiple fallback methods for external link navigation
- Apply Instagram-specific CSS classes for layout fixes

### Email Form Customization
- Mailchimp form ID and action URL are configured in index.html
- Apple-style animations are defined in styles.css (lines 179-1170)
- Input state management is handled in script.js (lines 616-725)
- Responsive breakpoints ensure proper display on all devices

### Responsive Design Maintenance
- Mobile-first approach: start with 320px base styles
- Use progressive enhancement for larger screens
- Test all breakpoints, especially 375px, 390px, and 430px for mobile
- Instagram browser requires additional CSS overrides
